MYSQL TUTORIAL: If everything installed correctly

Login to MYSQL:
        linux: sudo -u root -p 


        windows: 
                Navigate to where mysql is located, ex: bin, copy link from search bar and copy into CMD.
                Your CMD should look something like this:

                C:\Users\user> cd "C:\Program Files\MYSQL\MYSQL Server 8.0\bin"

                Then press [ENTER], it will display this:

                    C:\Program Files\MYSQL\MYSQL Server 8.0\bin>

                    Enter the following: mysql -u root -p
                    It will look like this:

                        C:\Program Files\MYSQL\MYSQL Server 8.0\bin>mysql -u root -p

                        You'll get promtped to enter your PW. If PW is valid,
                        Your prompt will show a Welcome to MYSQL monitor and your 
                        prompt will start with:

                                mysql> _

                        There is another way that allows you to access without going through previous process:

                    MYSQL Commands Walkthrough 


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1) To see what databases exist, type the command (NOTE: MYSQL commands are NOT case sensitive, 
    but it helps when adding to your code to prevent confusion):

        Command:

            SHOW DATABASES;


   Reminder: DON'T FORGET SEMICOLON! MYSQL will not read the command without it!

        Display:

            +--------------------+
            | Database           |
            +--------------------+
            | information_schema |
            | mysql              |
            | performance_schema |
            | sys                |
            | todos              |
            +--------------------+


2) To select a particular DB:

    USE [db name];

    ex: USE todos;


        **If there is no DB available, you can create a new DB by doing this:**

            CREATE DATABASE [name of your DB];

            ex: CREATE DATABASE todos;

            MYSQL will respond with: "Database changed"


3) To see what tables exist in the DB, it will list all tables recorded for the DB "todos":

        Command:

            SHOW TABLES;

        
        Display:

            +-----------------+
            | Tables_in_todos |
            +-----------------+
            | items           |
            +-----------------+



4) To see what is listed in the tables, you will need to select all using SELECT and asterisk (*) 
    and designate which DB it is pulling from:

        Command:

            SELECT * FROM [name of your table];

            ex: SELECT * FROM items;
            This command will only show you the main data like this:

        Display:

            +----+-------------+
            | id | task        |
            +----+-------------+
            |  1 | feed dragon |
            +----+-------------+


    To see all details included for the table itself, use "describe":

        Command:

            describe [name of your table];
            
            ex: describe items;

        
        Display:

            +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
            | Field | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
            +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
            | id    | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
            | task  | varchar(100) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
            +-------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+


        **If there is no table available, you can create a new table by doing this:**

            ex: CREATE TABLE items ( id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, task VARCHAR(100));

                This command creates a table called "items", and within the table, we are creating colums
                called "id" and "task". These two columns will allow us to pull data later by the id number 
                and the value contained in task. 

                        What does the extra stuff mean:

                            id => This is the first column in the table "items". It will auto-fill
                                   with a number as the designated id number after each new entry has been added to the table.

                                INT = Only whole numbers are used
                                
                                NOT NULL => id cannot be empty

                                PRIMARY KEY => It will be desginated as the main identifier for the table "items"

                                AUTO_INCREMENT => id will automatically go to the next available number. like id++


                            task => This is the second column in the table "items". In this part, your input for the "task" will go here.
                            
                                VARCHAR(100) => VARCHAR allows an entry to use uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers as valid characters. 
                                There is a character limit of 100, you can adjust it to whatever number you would like



                When created, MYSQL will display:

                    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)




5) Now to insert some data, you can do this:

    INSERT INTO [name of table] ( [name of column] ) VALUES (" [your content for designated column] ")

    ex: INSERT INTO items (task) VALUES ("feed dragon");



        MYSQL will send a reply:

            Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)



        Check to make sure it was added:

            Command:

                SELECT * FROM items;
                

            Display:

                +----+-------------+
                | id | task        |
                +----+-------------+
                |  1 | feed dragon |
                +----+-------------+


6) How to update an entry in your table:

    UPDATE [name of table] SET [designated column2] = ' [your new content for desiginated column 2] ' WHERE [designated Primary KEY column 1] = [number for referencing Primary Key in column 1];

    ex: UPDATE items SET task = 'rewire the time capacitor in the TARDIS' WHERE id = 1;

        MYSQL will reply back with:

            Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)


            The command updates the table "items" for column 2 "task", and seting the new content 
            entered in quotations, as the new value, then referencing the Primary Key to make sure it has the 
            correct entry within the table.



        Check to see if the update went through:

            Command:

                SELECT * FROM items;

            Display:
        
                +----+-----------------------------------------+
                | id | task                                    |
                +----+-----------------------------------------+
                |  1 | rewire the time capacitor in the TARDIS |
                +----+-----------------------------------------+


7) How to delete an entry:

    View table to see which entry to deleted:

        Command:

            SELECT * FROM items;


        Display:

            +----+------------------------------------------------------+
            | id | task                                                 |
            +----+------------------------------------------------------+
            |  1 | rewire the time capacitor in the TARDIS              |
            |  2 | Brush unicorn and give it apples treat, no brownies! |
            +----+------------------------------------------------------+


    DELETE FROM [name of table] WHERE [designated Primary KEY column 1] = [number for referencing Primary Key in column 1];

    ex: DELETE FROM items WHERE id = 2;

        MYSQL replies with:

            Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)


        Check to see if entry was deleted from table:

            Command:

                SELECT * FROM items;

            
            Display:

                +----+-----------------------------------------+
                | id | task                                    |
                +----+-----------------------------------------+
                |  1 | rewire the time capacitor in the TARDIS |
                +----+-----------------------------------------+
